# FIFA Fouls data

This data set contains the following information:

1. Name of the tournament
2. Name of the player
3. Number of yellow cards issued to the player
4. Number of double yellow cards issued to the player
5. Number of Red cards issues to the player (Not sure if the count
   includes the count in point 3)
6. Total minutes played by the player in that tournament
7. Total number of matches played by the player.


I'm assuming this is public data, so use it as you please. Aggregated as
part of a hackathon conducted by Gramener.
